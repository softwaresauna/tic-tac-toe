# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game (Croatian: Križić-Kružić).

## Purpose

An excercise in React using clean code, TDD and other Agile practices.

## Spec

### Version 1

For simplicity, the first version should be a two-human-player game played on a single computer.

At first, the board is empty.
The first player is X. The humans should decide on who is X and who is O.

When X makes the move, the next player is O.

The game proceeds until someone makes a straight line of three symbols, or its a draw. Diagonals count.
